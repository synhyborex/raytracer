The BVH is building and traversing correctly, but it's not working quite yet. I can render a scene with any number of planes, but only one object. Scenes with transforms render partial objects. 

Until I implemented the BVH, boxes worked great too. Shading is a little off now; this is due to a bug in how my intersections are being done with the BVH. This is the main bug with my BVH currently.

I haven't rendered the example files, they took too long without a working BVH.

I've altered simple.pov to render a single box and a number of different planes. There are other objects commented out, but only one will render of anything. simp_cam.pov also shows the partial rendering of transformed geometry in the BVH.

------Instructions------
If the binary won't execute, just type "make" and get a new one. It will be called "render".

To toggle shading modes, use a command line argument of the format
./render <width> <height> -I<filename> <shading>
where <shading> can be 0 for Phong, or 1 for Gaussian.
Each <> flag is optional, as defaults have been set to
<width> = 640
<height> = 480
-I<filename> = simple.pov
<shading> = 0

***IMPORTANT***
If while running the program you don't see the message "File parsing
complete." but you do see "Successfully opened....", try taking out any
extra blank space at the end of the .pov file. The last character in a
.pov file should be '}'. Sometimes the blank spaces at the end make
the file parsing indefinitely hang. If it's not this, then there are probably carriage returns messing up the file. You can use my versions of the files if you're not getting the expected results, since they definitely work with my parser, though I've made slight modifications as stated above.

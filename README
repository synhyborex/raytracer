Refractions and triangles are working as they should.
I don't have multiple light handling yet, so all the files
with multiple lights look weird. I also don't have boxes
implemented yet, so I couldn't render a few other files at all.

If the binary won't execute, just type "make" and get a new one. It will be called "render".

While refractions and triangles are working, it turns out my transforms
are not! I discovered that my shading is being done very incorrectly
and I haven't been able to figure out why. However, my intersect tests
do return real values and the objects are drawn in the right spots.

I've rendered what I could with the broken transforms, and for some
I've manually changed the translates to be included in the original
object definition so that I could make them look presentable :P

To toggle shading modes, use a command line argument of the format
./render <width> <height> -I<filename> <shading>
where <shading> can be 0 for Phong, or 1 for Gaussian.
Each <> flag is optional, as defaults have been set to
<width> = 640
<height> = 480
-I<filename> = simple.pov
<shading> = 0

***IMPORTANT***
If while running the program you don't see the message "File parsing
complete." but you do see "Successfully opened....", try taking out any
extra blank space at the end of the .pov file. The last character in a
.pov file should be '}'. Sometimes the blank spaces at the end make
the file parsing indefinitely hang. If it's not this, then there are probably carriage returns messing up the file. You can use my versions of the files if you're not getting the expected results, since they definitely work with my parser, though I've made slight modifications as stated above.

Files I've modified:
ugly_part.pov - took out the translates since transforms are broken
recurse_simp.pov - I think I just took out the space at the end
recurse_simp2.pov - added some spaces between braces for parsing purposes
simple_tri.pov - took out the spaces
simple_refract.pov - took out the spaces

Render Times:
ugly_part.pov - 10 min, 14.06 sec
recurse_simp.pov - 57.56 sec
recurse_simp2.pov - 15.54 sec
simple_tri.pov - 14.61 sec
simple_refract.pov - 2.57 sec
recurses.pov - not rendered
new.pov - 45.80 sec

Go to the folder "Rendered" to view all of the renderings.

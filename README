This is the source code for the final state of my project. It includes
the webpage material in the folder "web".

------Instructions------
If the binary won't execute, just type "make" and get a new one. It will be called "render".

To toggle shading modes, use a command line argument of the format
./render <width> <height> -I <filename> <filename> ....
OR
./render -I <filename> <filename> ....
width - desired width of image
height - desired height of image
-I - flag for filenames
You may choose as many files as you want, and they will be rendered.
However, for .m files, there is no guarantee they will be in the place you want them--they will be generated in the bottom left-ish unless explicit transforms are applied within raytrace.cpp.

***IMPORTANT***
If while running the program you don't see the message "File parsing
complete." but you do see "Successfully opened....", try taking out any
extra blank space at the end of the .pov file. The last character in a
.pov file should be '}'. Sometimes the blank spaces at the end make
the file parsing indefinitely hang.

Everything should be working: reflection, shading, shadows, and transforms.

If the binary won't execute, just type "make" and get a new one.

To toggle shading modes, use a command line argument of the format
./render <width> <height> -I<filename> <shading>
where <shading> can be 0 for Phong, or 1 for Gaussian.
Each <> flag is optional, as defaults have been set to
<width> = 640
<height> = 480
-I<filename> = simple.pov
<shading> = 0

If while running the program you don't see the message "File parsing
complete." but you do see "Successfully opened....", try taking out any
extra blank space at the end of the .pov file. The last character in a
.pov file should be '}'. Sometimes the blank spaces at the end make
the file parsing indefinitely hang.
